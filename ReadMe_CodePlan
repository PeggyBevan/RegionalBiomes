Data Structure - Chapter 1 final scripts

Data//
02_PREDICTSDivMetrics.csv
  - created in script 01. 
  - baseline dataset to use - do not edit
03_PREDICTSModelData.csv
 - created in script 01
 - urban land use and 'cannot decide' land uses have been removed.
 - extra variables added - land use (1-5), land use:use intensity (1-5), log richness, log abundance, common taxa


Scripts//

01_CreateSiteMetrics.R
 - uses database.rds from rawdata folder in another directory
 - groups observations from a study to one row to give species richness and total abundance
 - choose which columns to retain
 Output: 02_PREDICTSDivMetrics.csv
 
02_PreProcessingModelData
 - remove 'urban' and 'Cannot decide' land use types
 - edit land use & use intensity factor names & add regional biome names, create landuse:use intensity factor for all 5 land use types
 - create taxa variable
 Output: 03_PREDICTSModelData.csv
 
03_ExploreModelData
 - use this script to create summary tables of data
 - number of observations in each biome and regional biome
 - number of observations in each land use type by biome and regional biome
 - number of observations in each taxon group by biome and regional biome
 - it would be useful to save these tables as CSVs that can be brought back in later to subset
 
04_Global model and figs

05_Biom1
 - Subset biome 1 and do any data tidying (remove data-deficient areas)
 - run model and model selection against species richness and abundance
 - plot models
 
06_Biome4

07_Biome7
